## Project Goals

As year two of this pandemic passes, I am taking a personal interest in studying the number of covid cases to see if data can tell me when this might be over. I am still diligently wearing a N95 these days, but that doesn't mean I don't dream of the day I can sit in a restaurant unmasked again AND feel safe. I would also like to possibly find some data on the 1918 Flu and possibly compare the two pandemics.

## Project Description

Covid Act Now is the COVID-focused U.S initiative of Act Now Coalition. Launched in April 2020, thier COVID data and risk assessment includes every U.S. state, 380+ metros, 3,100+ counties, and two U.S. territories.
They have served over tens of millions of users since the beginning of the pandemic, and keep more than 200k subscribers up to date on COVID news and alerts.
They've supported hundreds of federal, state, and county officials as well as numerous multinational corporations and NGOs to develop data-driven COVID responses.
Using thier API, I can access this data to dive into the numbers and see if there is a downward trend that may allow us to stop wearing masks soon.


## The Plan

**Plan - Acquire - Prepare - Explore - Deliver**
